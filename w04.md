# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Main Memory](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/8_MainMemory.html)<br>
Quite thorough regarding main memory. From basic hardware, swapping, memory allocation, segmentation, and paging. Almost all of the points from the 4th week slide regarding memory are briefly explained on this website.

2. [Virtual Memory](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/9_VirtualMemory.html)<br>
Continuation of the discussion on point 1. If in point 1 it discusses main memory, here it discusses virtual memory. The explanation regarding page replacement is quite complete and numerous, in line with the points on this week's slide.

3. [C Pointers](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers)<br>
This website really helps me in understanding the use of pointers in the C language which is the material in this 4th week. The explanation is quite clear, starting with simple things such as what is an address in C, and entering the core of the discussion, namely pointers, accompanied by examples that are easy to understand.

4. [Address Binding and its Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/address-binding-and-its-types/)<br>
Address binding is a mapping from one address to another. To be executed, a program must be moved to main memory. The logical address created during execution needs to be translated by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) into a physical address.

5. [Understanding Big and Little Endian Byte Order
](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/)<br>
Besides explaining the meaning of big and little endian on this website, it also explains the difference between data and numbers. On this website the explanation is accompanied by an example so that it is easy to understand.

6. [Operating System - Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
This website provides summary of memory management in OS, from process address space to memory segmentation.

7. [Understanding Stack Based Buffer Overflow](https://payatu.com/blog/Siddharth-Bezalwar/understanding-stack-based-buffer-overflow#:~:text=EBP%20points%20to%20higher%20memory,next%20instruction%20to%20be%20executed.&text=When%20a%20function%20is%20executed,is%20pushed%20onto%20the%20stack.)<br>
This website is very interesting because this website explains about EBP, EIP, and ESP pointers which will make it easier for us to do the buffer overflow technique. In short, EBP is a base pointer to the current stack frame, ESP is the current stack pointer that contains the address being processed, and EIP is an instruction pointer that stores the next address when an instruction is finished.

8. [Swapping in Operating System](https://binaryterms.com/swapping-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Swapping is a method in memory management. This article explains in full the definition, example, and process of swapping.

9. [Understanding Shared Libraries in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20libraries%20are%20located,defined%20in%20%2Fetc%2Fld.)<br>
Shared libraries can be divided into 2 categories, namely dynamically linked libraries and dynamically loaded libraries. The shared libraries in Linux will be loaded by the ld.so and ld-linux.so programs. Further explanation about shared libraries can be seen on the website.

10. [How to manage memory with malloc, calloc, realloc, and free in C](https://youtu.be/lQP4X3odvHE)<br>
I learned about basic memory management in C using the common malloc, calloc, realloc, and free functions.
