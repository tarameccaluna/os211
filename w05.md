1. [Virtual memory vs. Virtual address space](https://superuser.com/questions/332564/virtual-memory-vs-virtual-address-space)<br>
In this page I learned about the difference between virtual memory and virtual address space. Virtual address space is an address limitation of a program's memory.

2. [Thrashing in Operating System (OS)](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html)<br>
The info contained in this page will be useful for those who need a larger space for their RAM. It also explains about page fault and swapping in OS.

3. [Page Fault](https://youtu.be/uqQOIahM868)<br>
A review of Page Fault in simple terms. It is sufficient to help me learn things that were not explained well in the slides.

4. [Virtual Memory: 10 Making Virtual Memory Fast](https://youtu.be/uyrSn3qbZ8U)<br>
This page explains how to make virtual memory runs faster. One of them is by using Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). TLB has smaller memory but is faster when accessed.

5. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
This page describes the Frame Allocation algorithm. Although the explanation on this website is quite long, the information provided on this website is very useful for understanding the allocation of frames.

6. [Cara Menambah Virtual Memory di Windows](https://winpreso.com/cara-menambah-virtual-memory-di-windows/)<br>
This page showed me how to allocate or increase the size of virtual memory on devices running Windows. This is because Windows usually allocates a small size of virtual memory automatically.

7. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
In operating systems that use memory management, the page replacement algorithm is needed to determine which pages are needed to be replaced with new pages. So it turns out that there are several kinds of algorithms that can be applied. 

8. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
If previously I have read about what is thrashing itself, this page explains how to solve the problem of thrashing.

9. [How Much RAM Does Windows Actually Need?](https://youtu.be/i9VFikWw44g)<br>
This page shows that newer operating systems does not necessarily require more memory than older ones. 

10. [Difference between Uniform Memory Access (UMA) and Non-uniform Memory Access (NUMA)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-uniform-memory-access-uma-and-non-uniform-memory-access-numa/)<br>
Multiprocessors can be categorized into 3: Uniform Memory Access (UMA), Non-uniform Memory Access (NUMA), and Cache-only Memory Access (COMA). Here, the focus is on UMA and NUMA and the comparisons between the two.
