1. [Process Synchronization](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs3013/c07/lectures/Section06-Sync.pdf)<br>
This page contains a PDF file that explains how processes are synced with each other, and how process synchronization is actually used.

2. [Race Condition in OS](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/process-synchronization-race-condition-in-os/)<br>
One of the materials presented in Chapter 6 is about Race Condition, and this link is sufficient to explain things that are not yet contained in the slides. Race Condition is a situation where the resulting final output depends on the sequence of executing instructions from different processes.

3. [Semaphores in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
This page discusses semaphore in the operating system. The explanation provided is easy to understand.

4. [Classical problems of Synchronization with Semaphore Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classical-problems-of-synchronization-with-semaphore-solution/)<br>
This page contains a list of classical problems of synchronization. It explains all classical problems of synchronization easily and with full illustrations.

5. [Contrasting Peterson’s and Dekker’s algorithms](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12621/contrasting-peterson-s-and-dekker-s-algorithms)<br>
This page explains the difference between Peterson and Dekker's algorithm in dealing with critical parts problems. Although the two solutions look similar because the two processes alternate by sending a signal when the first thread tries to process, it turns out that there is a difference in the behavior of the process.

6. [Difference between Deadlock and Starvation in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)<br>
Deadlock is a condition where a process holds a resource and waits for a process to hold another resource. Starvation is a condition that occurs when a high priority process is always executed, leaving a low priority process.  

7. [Bakery Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bakery-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Bakery is a synchronization algorithm. This page explains what the intention of the Bakery algorithm is. This page also demonstrates how to use this algorithm.

8. [What are Deadlock handling techniques in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-deadlock-handling-techniques-in-operating-system)<br>
It turns out that our operating system is smart enough to avoid deadlocks. This page discusses these mechanisms, such as deadlock prevention, deadlock avoidance, etc.

9. [Resource Allocation Graph in Operating System](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/resource-allocation-graph/)<br>
How many processes exist in the system, the number of instances of each resource type, and other information about the state of the system is represented by a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG). Like most graphs, RAG consists of 2 components, namely vertices and edges, each of which also has several types.

10. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/critical-section-problem)<br>
This page is a theory about critical section problem that is short and concise.
