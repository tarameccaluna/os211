1. [Difference between Process and Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)<br>
This page explains what a thread is and what a process is. It also explains about the differences between the two.

2. [Memory Mapping](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/inter_process_communication/inter_process_communication_memory_mapping.htm)<br>
This page discusses about Memory Mapping. This page is very interesting because it explains the Memory Mapping material briefly and clearly. In addition, there are various additional information such as types of Memory Mapping.

3. [Wait System Call in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wait-system-call-c/)<br>
A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. After child process terminates, parent continues its execution after wait system call instruction. 

4. [Process Memory Layout](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/files/teaching/nswi004/text/ch03s02s01.html)<br>
It turns out, the process layout in a memory can be represented in 4 different sections, namely the text section, the data section, the heap section, and the stack section. Each section is placed in one or more blocks and the block contents are managed by the process that owns it.

5. [What is the difference between fork & exec System call?](https://youtu.be/DKmBRl8j3Ak)<br>
A video explaining the difference between a fork and an exec and their use cases.

6. [OS Context Switching](https://winpreso.com/cara-menambah-virtual-memory-di-windows/)<br>
Explanation of context switching using machine language. I got amazed when the host uses machine language to describe context switching, then uses the concept of an interrupt as a trigger that initiates the switch. 

7. [Experiments with Multithreading in Parallel Computing](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.127.7775&rep=rep1&type=pdf)<br>
This is an experimental paper on the use of multithreading in programming. This paper is quite interesting because it discusses the process speed of a program using multithreading in parallel computing. Using multithread makes performance better, but it doesn't necessarily make all processes faster with more threads. This paper is very interesting to me because it shows evidence of the use of multithreading and explains the significant difference in performance with multithread well.

8. [Fork() in C Programming Language](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/)<br>
In this page, the author describes that "fork() is the primary method of process creation on Unix-like operating systems.". This page also explains that before you learn about fork(), there are prerequisites which must be understood: A good understanding of the C programming language and some familiarity with Unix-like operating systems. What's more interesting is the author provides examples of forks and advanced examples.

9. [Independent and Cooperating Processes](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart/537/lecturenotes/s4.html)<br>
Even though the page seems simple, in my opinion this website explains clearly and informatively. It also explains the topic by including an example so that we can visualize it.

10. [Multithreading vs Multiprocessing: What's the difference?](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-multiprocessing-and-multithreading.html)<br>
This article briefly and clearly discusses the differences between multithreading and multiprocessing. Also equipped with a table of differences between the two, making it easier to understand.
