1. [CPU and I/O Burst Cycles](https://youtu.be/pVzb3TUcDLo)<br>
This video explains CPU and I/O burst well. The explanation starts with the definition of CPU and I/O burst, then continues with an explanation of the cycle. 

2. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://youtu.be/4DhFmL-6SDA)<br>
This video covers the topic of preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling. It started with a brief description of CPU schedulers and dispatchers, and from there they slowly moved on to topics of preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling. In this particular video, I love how they cover important terms and backgrounds first to make sure we get enough basic knowledge to get into the main topic. 

3. [Scheduling Criteria](https://youtu.be/bWHFY8-rL5I)<br>
This video discusses criterias that would make scheduling algorithms different with each other: CPU usage, throughput, turnaround time, wait time, and response time. It didn't just mention them, but also explained each one in detail, which was very helpful in making me understand them better.

4. [CFS: Completely fair process scheduling in Linux](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/fair-scheduling-linux)<br>
CFS, which became part of Linux kernel 2.6.23 in 2007, is a scheduling class for normal (as opposed to real-time) processes and is therefore named SCHED_NORMAL. This page has helped me to understand CFS because it contains a detailed understanding of CFS, some core concepts, classic vs CFS preemptive scheduling, special features, and CFS implementation.

5. [What is load balancing?](https://www.citrix.com/en-id/solutions/app-delivery-and-security/load-balancing/what-is-load-balancing.html)<br>
Load balancing is defined as a methodical and efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers in a server field. Each load balancer resides between the client device and the backend server. This page contains a discussion of what load balancers are and how they work, hardware vs software based load balancers, common load balancing algorithms, and why load balancing is needed.

6. [Difference Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-multiprocessing.html)<br>
I am very interested in the explanation of this page because the explanation starts with a comparison on the chart first and then discusses each definition. Then, it is followed by the key difference which is very useful for contrasting the two comparisons. 

7. [What is NUMA (non-uniform memory access)?](http://www.techplayon.com/what-is-numa-non-uniform-memory-access/)<br>
In this page, NUMA is explained, including some of the features available on it.

8. [Chmod 644](https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-644/)<br>
This page provides a brief explanation of chmod with certain codes. On top of that, this page makes users choose what kind of chmod command they want.

9. [Apa itu GRUB?](https://qastack.id/ubuntu/347203/what-exactly-is-grub)<br>
I actually felt confused when installing LSFB.ova because there was an installation question asking about the GRUB boot loader. I finally found out about GRUB. 

10. [Difference between Hard real time and Soft real time system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hard-real-time-and-soft-real-time-system/)<br>
The definition of a real time system is a system whose work has a deadline. Real time systems are divided into two, namely Hard and Soft Real Time Systems. This article explains the differences between the two clearly so that it is easy to understand.
