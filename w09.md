# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Magnetic Disk](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/magnetic-disk)<br>
This page discusses types of disk storage from the oldest to the most recent. Magnetic disk is a type of secondary memory which is a flat disk covered with a magnetic layer to store a lot of information. It is used to store various programs and files.

2. [GNU GRUB](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/index.html)<br>
This page gave me a brief introduction to GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) and there is a link that will take you to a tutorial on how to download it.

3. [Magnetic Tape Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/magnetic-tape-memory/)<br>
Magnetic Tape is mainly used for backups. Back then, it was used for regular secondary storage before the days of hard disk drives. Data read/write speed is slower due to sequential access.

4. [Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/#:~:text=Disk%20scheduling%20is%20done%20by,known%20as%20I%2FO%20scheduling.&text=Multiple%20I%2FO%20requests%20may,time%20by%20the%20disk%20controller.)<br>
This page provides an explanation of Disk Scheduling Algorithms. It is interesting because it provides detailed explanations and also provide examples that are included with images so that it's easier to understand.

5. [RAID](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid)<br>
There are five RAID levels, each optimized for a specific situation. All RAID levels except RAID 0 offer protection against single drive failures.

6. [C-SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-scan-disk-scheduling-algorithm/)<br>
This page provides an explanation of C-Scan Algorithms. The explanation provided by this page can be easily understood, and it provides examples to make implementation easier for readers.

7. [What Is a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) & How Does It Work?](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/hdd/)<br>
This page explains the definition and workings of Hard Disk Drives. This page provides a very clear and detailed explanation, making it easier for readers to understand the explanation given. 

8. [Swap-Space Management in Operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-management-in-operating-system/)<br>
The area on the disk where swap processes are stored is called swap space. Swap-Space Management is one of the low-level tasks of the operating system that uses up disk space, so it will significantly reduce system performance because disk access is much slower than memory access. The page also provides a description of swap-space locations and examples.

9. [Apa itu Penyimpanan Massal (Mass Storage Device)?](http://abdul-azhim.blogspot.com/2018/04/apa-itu-penyimpanan-massal-mass-storage.html)<br>
A Mass Storage Device (MSD) is any storage device that makes it possible to store and port large amounts of data across computers, servers, and in an IT environment. Mass Storage refers to the various techniques and devices for storing large amounts of data. This page also provides an explanation of the types of MSD.

10. [Understanding and Using Systemd](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-and-using-systemd/)<br>
This page gave me systemd command examples. Some useful ones include start, stop, restart, reload, status, is-active, list-units.
